# Contact-Management---Mini-Feature-of-a-CRM

## Description

This is a **Contact Management App** that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a contact list. Users can add, edit, delete, and view contacts. The app features validation checks for email and phone number duplicates, and implements pagination and sorting.

**Technologies Used:**
- **Frontend**: React, Material-UI, Axios
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Database**: MongoDB

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 12 or higher)
- **MongoDB** (locally or use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud database)

### Backend Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/contact-management-app.git
   cd contact-management-app
   
2. Navigate to the backend folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

4. Start MongoDB locally if you're using a local database:
   ```bash
   mongod

5. Run the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
The backend server will run at http://localhost:5000.

Frontend Setup

  1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend

  2. Install the dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install

  3. Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
The frontend server will run at http://localhost:3000.
## Database Schema

The backend uses **MongoDB** with a `Contact` model that consists of the following fields:

- **firstName** (String): The first name of the contact (required).
- **lastName** (String): The last name of the contact (required).
- **email** (String): The email address of the contact (required). Validated to ensure the email format is correct.
- **phone** (String): The phone number of the contact (required). Validated to ensure the phone number format is correct.
- **company** (String): The company associated with the contact (required).
- **jobTitle** (String): The job title of the contact (required).

### Validation

1. **Email Validation**: 
   - The email must follow the standard email format (e.g., `example@domain.com`).
   - Both the frontend (React) and backend (MongoDB) enforce this validation to ensure data integrity.

2. **Phone Validation**:
   - The phone number must follow the standard phone number format, allowing for various international formats (e.g., `+1 (123) 456-7890`).
   - This validation is implemented both on the frontend (React) and the backend (MongoDB) to prevent invalid phone numbers from being submitted.

3. **Other Fields**:
   - The `firstName`, `lastName`, `company`, and `jobTitle` fields are required but do not have additional specific formatting rules beyond being non-empty.

This ensures that all contacts are stored with proper data formats and prevents invalid data from entering the system.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Handling Duplicate Entries for Email and Phone
- **Problem**: Initially, the form allowed duplicate email addresses and phone numbers, which could lead to data inconsistencies and issues when querying contacts.
- **Solution**: I implemented server-side validation to check for duplicate entries before submitting the form. This ensures that no two contacts can have the same email or phone number, preventing data duplication and maintaining data integrity.

### Challenge 2: Frontend and Backend Synchronization
- **Problem**: Ensuring that the frontend (React) correctly reflected changes in the UI after performing CRUD operations on the backend (Express).
- **Solution**: I used Axios to make asynchronous HTTP requests from React to the Express backend. After each operation (such as adding, updating, or deleting a contact), I updated the frontend state, ensuring that the UI reflects real-time changes without the need for manual refreshes.

### Challenge 3: Pagination and Sorting
- **Problem**: Handling large data sets caused performance issues, making the UI feel sluggish and unresponsive, especially when displaying many contacts.
- **Solution**: I implemented pagination on the frontend using Material-UIâ€™s Pagination component, and handled sorting on the backend via query parameters. This allows users to navigate large data sets efficiently, while the sorted and paginated data improves performance and provides a more user-friendly interface.
